- Live Site URL: (https://caseylawver.github.io/qr-code-challenge/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

This project provided some quick practice in recreating a design using CSS Flexbox. A QR code is a simple way to direct traffic to your website. A clean simple layout is the best way to showcase this.

Some of the concepts I will continue focusing on are:

- Mapping out the html elements in the beginning
- Creating Responsive designs

This is a responsive mobile-first webpage.



### Continued development

I plan to create many more responsive websites with CSS Flexbox. My next step is learning JavaScript and React.
